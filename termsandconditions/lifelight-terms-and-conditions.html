    not own, you must have the owner's permission to do so. You will be
    responsible for complying with these terms, whether or not you own the
    Device.</p>

    TO</h3>
<p>Lifelight may contain links to other independent websites which are
    not provided by us. Those independent sites are not under our control,
    and we are not responsible for and have not checked and approved their
    content or their privacy policies (if any).</p>

    whether to use any independent sites, including whether to buy any
    products or services offered by them or follow advice or recommendations
    given by them.</p>

<p>You agree that you will:</p>
<ul>
    <li>not rent, lease, sub-license, loan, provide, or otherwise make
        available, Lifelight in any form, in whole or in part to any person without
        prior written consent from us;
    </li>
    <li>not copy Lifelight (or any part of it), except as part of the normal
        use of Lifelight or where it is necessary for the purpose of back-up or
        operational security;
    </li>
    <li>not translate, merge, adapt, vary, alter or modify, the whole or
        any part of Lifelight nor permit Lifelight or any part of it to be combined

        to use Lifelight on devices as permitted in these terms;
    </li>
    <li>not disassemble, de-compile, reverse engineer or create
        derivative works based on the whole or any part of Lifelight nor attempt to
        do any such things, except to the extent that (by virtue of sections 50B
        and 296A of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988) such actions
        cannot be prohibited because they are necessary to decompile the
        Lifelight Application to obtain the information necessary to create an
        independent program that can be operated with the Lifelight Application
        or with another program (Permitted Objective), and provided that the
        information obtained by you during such activities:
        <ul>
            <li>is not disclosed or communicated without our prior written
                consent to any third party to whom it is not necessary to disclose or
                communicate it in order to achieve the Permitted Objective; and
            </li>
            <li>is not used to create any software that is substantially
                similar in its expression to the Lifelight Application;
            </li>
            <li>is kept secure; and</li>
            <li>is used only for the Permitted Objective;</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>comply with all applicable technology control or export laws and
        regulations that apply to the technology used or supported by

<h3>ACCEPTABLE USE RESTRICTIONS</h3>
<p>You must:</p>
<ul>
    <li>not use Lifelight in any unlawful manner, for any unlawful
        purpose, or in any manner inconsistent with these terms, or act

<h3>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS</h3>
<p>You acknowledge that all intellectual property rights in Lifelight
    throughout the world belong to us (or our licensors), that rights in Lifelight
    are licensed (not sold) to you, and that you have no intellectual property
    rights in, or to, Lifelight other than the right to use Lifelight in accordance
    with these terms.</p>
<h3>OUR RESPONSIBILITY FOR LOSS OR DAMAGE SUFFERED BY YOU –
    THIS CLAUSE ONLY APPLIES TO PATIENTS.</h3>
<p>IF YOU ARE A HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL, OUR LIABILITY TO YOU
    IS COVERED BY THE AGREEMENT WITH THE HEALTHCARE PROVIDER
    EITHER DIRECTLY WITH US OR WITH AN INTERMEDIARY PROVIDING
    SERVICES TO YOUR HEALTHCARE PROVIDER.</p>
<p>We are responsible to you for foreseeable loss and damage caused
    by us. If we fail to comply with these terms, we are responsible for loss or
    damage you suffer that is a foreseeable result of our breaking these terms
    or our failing to use reasonable care and skill, but we are not responsible
    for any loss or damage that is not foreseeable. Loss or damage is
    foreseeable if either it is obvious that it will happen or if, at the time this
    licence was made, both we and you knew it might happen.</p>
<p>We do not exclude or limit in any way our liability to you where it
    would be unlawful to do so. This includes liability for death or personal
    injury caused by our negligence or the negligence of our employees,
    agents, or subcontractors or for fraud or fraudulent
    misrepresentation.</p>
<p>When we are liable for damage to your property. If defective digital
    content that we have supplied damages a device or digital content
    belonging to you, we will either repair the damage or pay you
    compensation. However, we will not be liable for damage that you could
    have avoided by following our advice to apply an update offered to you
    free of charge or for damage that was caused by you failing to correctly
    follow installation instructions or to have in place the minimum system
    requirements advised by us.</p>
<p>Limitations to Lifelight. If used correctly, Lifelight enables you to
    take accurate Vital Signs readings as per the Instructions For Use. Lifelight
    does not interpret the results of your Vital Signs readings. This must
    always be done by a healthcare professional. You must obtain professional
    or specialist advice before taking, or refraining from taking, any action on
    the basis of information obtained from Lifelight. Although we make
    reasonable efforts to update the information provided by Lifelight, we
    make no representations, warranties, or guarantees, whether express or
    implied, that such information is accurate, complete, or up to date.</p>
<p>Xim (Lifelight) does not store your identifiable Vital Signs readings.
    Instead, this information is transmitted to the Healthcare Provider or
    intermediary providing services to your Healthcare Provider, who will be
    responsible for storing such information as part of the health and patient
    care services they provide or transmitted immediately back to you on the
    Device.</p>
<p>No patient identifiable data is saved on the Device or on the cloud
    infrastructure of the Lifelight SaaS Solution. Non-patient identifiable data
    is stored in the cloud infrastructure of the Lifelight SaaS Solution for
    quality control and to provide data for the continued testing of quality and
    efficacy of the algorithm (machine learning). Xim (Lifelight) for the
    purposes of registration with the ICO (Information Commissioner’s Office
    in the United Kingdom) under the Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA 2018) is,
    therefore, a Data Processor and not the Data Controller.</p>
<p>Check that Lifelight is suitable for you. You acknowledge that
    Lifelight has not been developed to meet your individual requirements,
    and that it is, therefore, your responsibility to ensure that the facilities and
    functions of Lifelight as described in the Documentation meet your
    requirements.</p>
<p>We are not responsible for events outside our control. If our
    provision of Lifelight or support for Lifelight is delayed by an event outside
    our control, then your Healthcare Provider or intermediary providing
    services to your Healthcare Provider will let you know, and we will take
    steps to minimise the effect of the delay. We will not be liable for delays
    caused by the event. You can always end your contract with us should you
    no longer wish to use Lifelight.</p>
<h3>IN THE EVENT OF ANY MEDICAL EMERGENCIES YOU SHOULD
    ALWAYS CALL YOUR HEALTHCARE PROVIDER DIRECTLY OR USE ALTERNATE
    NHS HELPLINES</h3>
<h3>WE MAY END YOUR RIGHTS TO USE LIFELIGHT IF YOU BREAK
    THESE TERMS</h3>
<p>If we consider that a breach of these terms has occurred, we may
    take such action as we deem appropriate.</p>
<p>If you have broken these terms in a serious way (if you are a
    Healthcare Professional it may also cause the Healthcare Provider to
    breach their agreement with us or one of their intermediaries providing
    services to the Healthcare Provider), we may take all or any of the
    following actions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>immediate, temporary or permanent withdrawal of your right to
        use Lifelight;
    </li>
    <li>immediate, temporary or permanent removal of any data
        uploaded by you to Lifelight;
    </li>
    <li>issue of a warning to you or the Healthcare Provider or an
        intermediary providing services to your Healthcare Provider (if you are a
        Healthcare Professional);
    </li>
    <li>legal action against you or the Healthcare Provider or an
        intermediary providing services to your Healthcare Provider (if you are a
        Healthcare Professional);
    </li>
    <li>disclosure of such information to law enforcement authorities as
        we reasonably feel is necessary or as required by law.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>The actions we may take are not limited to those described above,
    and we may take any other action we reasonably deem appropriate.</p>
<p>If we end your rights to use Lifelight:</p>
<ul>
    <li>you must stop all activities authorised by these terms, including
        your use of Lifelight.
    </li>
    <li>you must delete or remove the Lifelight Application from
        the device in your possession and immediately destroy all and any copies
        of the Lifelight Application which you have and confirm to us that you
        have done so;
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>TRANSFERRING THIS LICENCE TO SOMEONE ELSE</h3>
<p>We may transfer, assign, charge, sub-contract, or deal in any other
    manner with all or any of our rights and obligations under these
    terms.</p>
<p>You, however, may only transfer your rights or your obligations
    under these terms to another person if we agree in writing.</p>
<h3>RIGHTS FOR THIRD PARTIES</h3>
<p>Except the rights the organisation you represent has, these terms
    do not give rise to any rights under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties)
    Act 1999 to enforce any of its terms.</p>
<h3>IF A COURT FINDS PART OF THIS CONTRACT ILLEGAL, THE REST
    WILL CONTINUE IN FORCE</h3>
<p>Each of the paragraphs of these terms operates separately. If any
    court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful, the
    remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.</p>
<h3>EVEN IF WE DELAY ENFORCING THESE TERMS, WE CAN STILL
    ENFORCE THEM LATER</h3>
<p>Even if we delay in enforcing of these terms, we can still enforce
    them later. If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are
    required to do under this licence, or if we delay in taking steps against you
    in respect of your breaking these terms that will not mean that you do not
    have to do those things and it will not prevent us from taking steps
    against you at a later date.</p>
<h3>WHICH LAWS APPLY TO THESE TERMS AND JURISDICTION</h3>
<p>These terms, their subject matter and formation (and any non-
    contractual disputes or claims) are governed by English law and subject to
    the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.</p>
<p><strong>BY TICKING THE "ACCEPT" BOX BELOW YOU AGREE TO THESE
    TERMS WHICH WILL BIND YOU.</strong></p>
<p><strong>IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS DO NOT TICK THE
    "ACCEPT" BOX BELOW.</strong></p>
