        and 296A of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988) such actions

        independent program that can be operated with the Application
        or with another program (Permitted Objective), and provided that the
        information obtained by you during such activities:

            <li>is not disclosed or communicated without our prior written
                consent to any third party to whom it is not necessary to disclose or

<h3>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS</h3>
<p>You acknowledge that all intellectual property rights in LLTry
    throughout the world belong to us (or our licensors), that rights in Lifelight
    are licensed (not sold) to you, and that you have no intellectual property
    rights in, or to, LLTry other than the right to use LLTry in accordance
    with these terms.</p>
<h3>OUR RESPONSIBILITY FOR LOSS OR DAMAGE SUFFERED BY YOU –
    THIS CLAUSE ONLY APPLIES TO PATIENTS.</h3>
<p>LLTry is provided "as is" for demonstration purposes only. We do not
    warrant that the application is accurate, reliable, or fit for any medical 
    or diagnostic purpose.</p>
<p><b>We are responsible to you for foreseeable loss and damage caused
    by us.</b> If we fail to comply with these terms, we are responsible for loss or
    damage you suffer that is a foreseeable result of our breaking these terms
    or our failing to use reasonable care and skill, but we are not responsible
    for any loss or damage that is not foreseeable. Loss or damage is
    foreseeable if either it is obvious that it will happen or if, at the time this
    licence was made, both we and you knew it might happen.</p>
<p><b>We do not exclude or limit in any way our liability to you where it
    would be unlawful to do so.</b> This includes liability for death or personal
    injury caused by our negligence or the negligence of our employees,
    agents, or subcontractors or for fraud or fraudulent
    misrepresentation.</p>
    <p><b>When we are liable for damage to your property.</b> If defective digital
        content that we have supplied damages a device or digital content
        belonging to you, we will either repair the damage or pay you
        compensation. However, we will not be liable for damage that you could
        have avoided by following our advice to apply an update offered to you
        free of charge or for damage that was caused by you failing to correctly
        follow installation instructions or to have in place the minimum system
        requirements advised by us.</p>
<h3>IN THE EVENT OF ANY MEDICAL EMERGENCIES YOU SHOULD ALWAYS CALL
    YOUR HEALTHCARE PROVIDER DIRECTLY OR USE YOUR NATIONAL
    HEALTHCARE SYSTEM’S HELPLINES.</h3>
   <br>
<h3>WE MAY END YOUR RIGHTS TO USE LIFELIGHT IF YOU BREAK
    THESE TERMS</h3>
<p>If we consider that a breach of these terms has occurred, we may
    take such action as we deem appropriate.</p>
<p>If you have broken these terms in a serious way, we may take all or any of the
    following actions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>immediate, temporary or permanent withdrawal of your right to
        use LLTry;
    </li>
    <li>immediate, temporary or permanent removal of any data
        uploaded by you to LLTry;
    </li>
    <li>issue of a warning to you;
    </li>
    <li>legal action against you;
    </li>
    <li>disclosure of such information to law enforcement authorities as
        we reasonably feel is necessary or as required by law.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>The actions we may take are not limited to those described above,
    and we may take any other action we reasonably deem appropriate.</p>
<p>If we end your rights to use LLTry:</p>
<ul>
    <li>you must stop all activities authorised by these terms, including
        your use of LLTry.
    </li>
    <li>you must delete or remove the Application from
        the device in your possession and immediately destroy all and any copies
        of the Application which you have and confirm to us that you
        have done so;
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>TRANSFERRING THIS LICENCE TO SOMEONE ELSE</h3>
<p>We may transfer, assign, charge, sub-contract, or deal in any other
    manner with all or any of our rights and obligations under these
    terms.</p>
<p>You, however, may only transfer your rights or your obligations
    under these terms to another person if we agree in writing.</p>
<h3>RIGHTS FOR THIRD PARTIES</h3>
<p>Except the rights the organisation you represent has, these terms
    do not give rise to any rights under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties)
    Act 1999 to enforce any of its terms.</p>
<h3>IF A COURT FINDS PART OF THIS CONTRACT ILLEGAL, THE REST
    WILL CONTINUE IN FORCE</h3>
<p>Each of the paragraphs of these terms operates separately. If any
    court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful, the
    remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.</p>
<h3>EVEN IF WE DELAY ENFORCING THESE TERMS, WE CAN STILL
    ENFORCE THEM LATER</h3>
<p>Even if we delay in enforcing of these terms, we can still enforce
    them later. If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are
    required to do under this licence, or if we delay in taking steps against you
    in respect of your breaking these terms that will not mean that you do not
    have to do those things and it will not prevent us from taking steps
    against you at a later date.</p>
<h3>WHICH LAWS APPLY TO THESE TERMS AND JURISDICTION</h3>
<p>These terms, their subject matter and formation (and any non- contractual disputes or claims) are
    governed by English law and subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.
    If you are not based in England and Wales, you can bring legal proceedings in respect of Lifelight in
    the country that you are based in.</p>
