        Healthcare Professional); and
    </li>
    <li>that we receive from the healthcare provider that you represent

    Use.</p>
<h3>IF SOMEONE ELSE OWNS THE DEVICE YOU ARE USING</h3>
<p>If you download the Lifelight Application onto a Device that you do
    not own, you must have the owner's permission to do so. You will be
    responsible for complying with these terms, whether or not you own the
    Device.</p>
<h3>WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR OTHER WEBSITES YOU LINK
    TO</h3>
<p>Lifelight may contain links to other independent websites which are

    whether to use any independent sites, including whether to buy any
    products or services offered by them or follow advice or recommendations
    given by them.</p>

        prior written consent from us;
    </li>
    <li>not copy Lifelight (or any part of it), except as part of the normal

    <li>not disassemble, de-compile, reverse engineer or create
        derivative works based on the whole or any part of Lifelight nor attempt to
        do any such things, except to the extent that (by virtue of sections 50B
        and 296A of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988) such actions
        cannot be prohibited because they are necessary to decompile the
        Lifelight Application to obtain the information necessary to create an
        independent program that can be operated with the Lifelight Application
        or with another program (Permitted Objective), and provided that the

        <ul>
            <li>is not disclosed or communicated without our prior written
                consent to any third party to whom it is not necessary to disclose or

<h3>OUR RESPONSIBILITY FOR LOSS OR DAMAGE SUFFERED BY YOU –
    THIS CLAUSE ONLY APPLIES TO PATIENTS.</h3>
<p>IF YOU ARE A HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL, OUR LIABILITY TO YOU IS COVERED BY
    THE AGREEMENT WITH THE HEALTHCARE PROVIDER EITHER DIRECTLY WITH US OR
    WITH AN INTERMEDIARY PROVIDING SERVICES TO YOUR HEALTHCARE PROVIDER.</p>
<p><b>We are responsible to you for foreseeable loss and damage caused
    by us.</b> If we fail to comply with these terms, we are responsible for loss or
    damage you suffer that is a foreseeable result of our breaking these terms
    or our failing to use reasonable care and skill, but we are not responsible
    for any loss or damage that is not foreseeable. Loss or damage is
    foreseeable if either it is obvious that it will happen or if, at the time this
    licence was made, both we and you knew it might happen.</p>
<p><b>We do not exclude or limit in any way our liability to you where it
    would be unlawful to do so.</b> This includes liability for death or personal
    injury caused by our negligence or the negligence of our employees,
    agents, or subcontractors or for fraud or fraudulent
    misrepresentation.</p>
    <p><b>When we are liable for damage to your property.</b> If defective digital
        content that we have supplied damages a device or digital content
        belonging to you, we will either repair the damage or pay you
        compensation. However, we will not be liable for damage that you could
        have avoided by following our advice to apply an update offered to you
        free of charge or for damage that was caused by you failing to correctly
        follow installation instructions or to have in place the minimum system
        requirements advised by us.</p>
    <p><b>Limitations to Lifelight.</b> If used correctly, Lifelight enables you to
        take accurate Vital Signs readings as per the Instructions For Use. Lifelight
        does not interpret the results of your Vital Signs readings. This must
        always be done by a healthcare professional. You must obtain professional
        or specialist advice before taking, or refraining from taking, any action on
        the basis of information obtained from Lifelight. Although we make
        reasonable efforts to update the information provided by Lifelight, we
        make no representations, warranties, or guarantees, whether express or
        implied, that such information is accurate, complete, or up to date.</p>
    <p><b>Check that Lifelight is suitable for you.</b>You acknowledge that Lifelight has not been
        developed to meet your individual requirements, and that it is, therefore, your
        responsibility to ensure
        that the facilities and functions of Lifelight as described in the Documentation meet your
        requirements.</p>
    <p>We are not responsible for events outside our control. If our provision of Lifelight or
        support for Lifelight is delayed by an event outside our control, then your Healthcare
        Provider or intermediary providing services to your Healthcare Provider will let you know, and we will
        take steps to minimise the effect of the delay. We will not be liable for delays caused by
        the event. You can always end your contract with us should you no longer wish to use Lifelight.</p>
<h3>IN THE EVENT OF ANY MEDICAL EMERGENCIES YOU SHOULD ALWAYS CALL
    YOUR HEALTHCARE PROVIDER DIRECTLY OR USE YOUR NATIONAL
    HEALTHCARE SYSTEM’S HELPLINES.</h3>
   <br>
<h3>WE MAY END YOUR RIGHTS TO USE LIFELIGHT IF YOU BREAK
    THESE TERMS</h3>
<p>If we consider that a breach of these terms has occurred, we may
    take such action as we deem appropriate.</p>
<p>If you have broken these terms in a serious way (if you are a
    Healthcare Professional it may also cause the Healthcare Provider to
    breach their agreement with us or one of their intermediaries providing
    services to the Healthcare Provider), we may take all or any of the
    following actions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>immediate, temporary or permanent withdrawal of your right to
        use Lifelight;
    </li>
    <li>immediate, temporary or permanent removal of any data
        uploaded by you to Lifelight;
    </li>
    <li>issue of a warning to you or the Healthcare Provider or an
        intermediary providing services to your Healthcare Provider (if you are a
        Healthcare Professional);
    </li>
    <li>legal action against you or the Healthcare Provider or an
        intermediary providing services to your Healthcare Provider (if you are a
        Healthcare Professional);
    </li>
    <li>disclosure of such information to law enforcement authorities as
        we reasonably feel is necessary or as required by law.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>The actions we may take are not limited to those described above,
    and we may take any other action we reasonably deem appropriate.</p>
<p>If we end your rights to use Lifelight:</p>
<ul>
    <li>you must stop all activities authorised by these terms, including
        your use of Lifelight.
    </li>
    <li>you must delete or remove the Lifelight Application from
        the device in your possession and immediately destroy all and any copies
        of the Lifelight Application which you have and confirm to us that you
        have done so;
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>TRANSFERRING THIS LICENCE TO SOMEONE ELSE</h3>
<p>We may transfer, assign, charge, sub-contract, or deal in any other
    manner with all or any of our rights and obligations under these
    terms.</p>
<p>You, however, may only transfer your rights or your obligations
    under these terms to another person if we agree in writing.</p>
<h3>RIGHTS FOR THIRD PARTIES</h3>
<p>Except the rights the organisation you represent has, these terms
    do not give rise to any rights under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties)
    Act 1999 to enforce any of its terms.</p>
<h3>IF A COURT FINDS PART OF THIS CONTRACT ILLEGAL, THE REST
    WILL CONTINUE IN FORCE</h3>
<p>Each of the paragraphs of these terms operates separately. If any
    court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful, the
    remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.</p>
<h3>EVEN IF WE DELAY ENFORCING THESE TERMS, WE CAN STILL
    ENFORCE THEM LATER</h3>
<p>Even if we delay in enforcing of these terms, we can still enforce
    them later. If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are
    required to do under this licence, or if we delay in taking steps against you
    in respect of your breaking these terms that will not mean that you do not
    have to do those things and it will not prevent us from taking steps
    against you at a later date.</p>
<h3>WHICH LAWS APPLY TO THESE TERMS AND JURISDICTION</h3>
<p>These terms, their subject matter and formation (and any non- contractual disputes or claims) are
    governed by English law and subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.
    If you are not based in England and Wales, you can bring legal proceedings in respect of Lifelight in
    the country that you are based in.</p>
<p><strong>By ticking the box, you agree to these terms which will bind you.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you do not agree to these terms do not tick the box.</strong></p>
