        <h3><strong>Exclusively for Clinical Investigation</strong></h3>
        <div class="column2">
            <p>Lifelight® EA Vision-RWE non-contact medical device software is intended for use as part of a 
                clinical research/investigation (rather than for informational use only) and will also be 
                used for monitoring of the following vital signs:</p>
           
            <ul>
                <li>non-invasive blood pressure (mmhg),</li>
                <li>pulse rate (bpm),</li>
                <li>and respiration rate (rpm).</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Intended patient populations include: adult patients. The medical device software is
                not intended for
                paediatric use.</p>
            <p>The most likely locations for use are hospitals, clinics, residential care, other
                healthcare environments and the patient’s home.</p>
            <p>The Lifelight® EA Vision-RWE medical device software is to be used either by care providers, or
                by a
                patient who has been advised in its appropriate use by a care provider.</p>
            <p>Lifelight® EA is indicated for use with patients at rest, during no-motion, in a
                well-lit environment.</p>
            <p><strong>NOTE: Lifelight® EA Vision-RWE Investigational Device is exclusively for clinical investigation. It should not be
                used for direct diagnosis and is not
                intended to replace traditional methods of diagnosis or treatment.</strong></p>

            <h3><strong>Exceptions</strong> / Warning:</h3>
            <p><strong>For the attention of healthcare practitioners:</strong><br>
                Some drugs, therapies, health and skin conditions (including cosmetics, facial
                tattoos and excessive sweat) may interfere with readings.</p>
            <p>If there is any reason to question the accuracy of the results, use other clinically
                valid methods for verification.</p>
            <p><strong>For the attention of patients and/or their carers and care
                providers:</strong><br>
                Please be aware that vital signs can fluctuate, since they respond to small changes
                in the body, and with the time of day. It is unusual for them to remain at exactly
                the same value all the time. If you are checking your vital signs regularly, e.g.
                blood pressure on different days, you should ideally take readings at the same
                time and under the same conditions.</p>
            <p>If a reading returns results that seems to be abnormal, but you do not feel
                unwell, do not panic, as this can happen. Relax and take a break for 5 minutes
                before checking vital signs again. Low blood pressure (hypotension), high blood
                pressure (hypertension), the reasons for consistently fast (tachycardia) or
                consistently slow (bradycardia) heart rate; or for unusual respiratory rates, can
                only be diagnosed by a qualified healthcare professional. If you have any concerns
                about your results, please contact your GP surgery or pharmacist.</p>
            <p>Ideally, to get the most accurate values, you should wait at least an hour after
                eating, smoking, caffeine, alcohol, or exercise, as these may affect the results.
                You should be relaxed and keep still during the reading. Do not use this medical
                device software
                if you suffer from atrial or ventricular premature beats or atrial fibrillation.</p>

                can occur with one or more of the following causes:</p>
            <h3>Lighting</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The subject (the person being checked) is poorly lit.</li>
                <li>The subject is strongly lit from behind or above and not adequately from in

                <li>The background to the subject is very brightly lit.</li>
                <li>A mirror or reflective surface is in the background of the subject.</li>
                <li>There are strong shadows on the subject’s forehead and cheeks.</li>
                <li>The light changes during the reading. Other than flickering lights, this
                    could be caused by people or objects moving in the background.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Movement</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The device is moving too much during the reading. If you can't hold the
                    device still, avoid hand-holding the device and instead use a stand or steady
                    the device against an object.

        <h2>What Lifelight® EA does and how it works</h2>
        <p>Lifelight® EA is a software application that is a medical device. It is intended to be a
            simple way to estimate pulse, respiration and blood pressure in 40 seconds or less.
            Through the device camera, the software measures changes in facial skin colour each time
            the heart beats. When the colour information is processed, the software provides
            indicative estimates for pulse, respiration and blood pressure.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="preparation"><!--Preparation and setup-->
        <h2> Preparation and set up of Lifelight® EA before taking a reading. </h2>
        <h3>Device preparation and minimum requirements.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Lifelight® EA is designed to work on a range of validated mobile devices. Ensure the
                device’s operating system is up to date.
            </li>
            <li>Make sure you are using the latest version of the Lifelight® EA app.</li>
            <li>Ensure the device is adequately charged for your requirements.</li>
            <li>Ensure the device lenses are clean.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>IT networks characteristics and IT security measures.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Lifelight® EA requires a stable connection to the internet to function.</li>
            <li> The minimum connection speed required is 0.128 mbps upload and 0.128 mbps
                download.
            </li>
            <li>For the software to run as intended, the connection to the Wi-Fi must be secure and
                protected from unauthorized access.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Keeping the device still.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The device running Lifelight® EA must be held as still as possible when taking a
                reading.
            </li>
            <li>If the device is held in a stand resting on a surface, that surface should be free
                from movement or vibration.
            </li>
            <li>Ideal stands allow the device to be repositioned and angled to accommodate the
                different heights of subjects if used by an operator for multiple subjects.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Environment, lighting and special facilities.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>For optimum Lifelight® EA results, the environment, room or space should be
                distraction-free and allow the subject’s face to be well illuminated.
            </li>
            <li>Ideal lighting conditions allow the subject’s face to be well lit without strong
                shadows. Multiple strong, diffuse light sources are ideal.
            </li>
            <li>Lifelight® EA may function poorly if the subject’s face is lit from a single strong
                light source that creates strong shadows across the forehead and cheeks.
            </li>
            <li>Lifelight® EA may function poorly if the subject is strongly backlit, and/or if the
                space the subject is in is strongly lit and the subject isn’t.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Subject – the person being checked.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Lifelight® EA is validated for subjects age 18 and above.</li>
            <li>Lifelight® EA works by measuring skin colour from cheeks and forehead. Therefore
                these areas of the subject's face must be visible and well illuminated.
            </li>
            <li>Subjects should remove glasses, hats and heads-carves if they obscure facial skin or
                create strong shadows.
            </li>
            <li>Subjects should arrange hair so that their facial skin is exposed and free from
                strong shadows.
            </li>
            <li>If it is safe to do so under clinical guidance, remove masks (such as oxygen masks)
                for the duration of the reading.
            </li>
            <li>Some subjects are concerned that they are being videoed. Lifelight® EA only uses the
                images taken with the camera to measure the numeric colour values of facial skin. It
                is only these numeric colour values that are used to calculate the vital signs. The
                images are discarded.
            </li>
            <li>Subjects should avoid food, caffeine, tobacco and alcohol for at least 1 hour before
                taking a reading.
            </li>
            <li>Subjects should sit quietly for a few minutes before taking the reading.</li>
            <li>Subjects should be relaxed with their back and feet supported and arms and legs
                uncrossed.
