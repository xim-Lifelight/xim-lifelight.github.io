    <h2>Lifelight®  Intended Purpose / Indications For Use</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Lifelight® non-contact medical device software is intended for non-invasive measurement of blood pressure (mmHg) and pulse rate (bpm), in adult patients aged 18 and above, regardless of ethnicity or gender. The software is not intended for pregnant women, paediatric use, or persons with atrial fibrillation or low perfusion conditions like anaemia, jaundice, birthmarks, rosacea, psoriasis, acute acne and erythropoietic protoporphyria. Lifelight® measures vital physiological parameters through a method called remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) which is a non-invasive means of detecting cardiovascular blood volume pulse (BVP) through small changes in reflected light from the skin surface. Lifelight® works by using a mobile device camera to detect the minute colour changes in the skin of a patient’s face caused by heart beats.</p>
      <p><strong>Intended Patient Population:</strong><br>
        Adult patients aged 18 and above, regardless of ethnicity or gender. This medical device software is not intended for pregnant women, paediatric use, or persons with atrial fibrillation or low perfusion conditions like anaemia, jaundice, birthmarks, rosacea, psoriasis, acute acne and erythropoietic protoporphyria.</p>
      <p><strong>Intended Environments of Use and Intended Users:</strong><br>
        The most likely locations for use are hospitals, clinics, residential care, other healthcare environments and the patient’s home.</p>
      <p>The Lifelight® software is to be used either by healthcare providers, or by a patient who is under the instruction of a healthcare provider.</p>
      <p>Lifelight® is indicated for use with patients at rest, during no-motion, in a well-lit environment.</p>
      <h3><strong>Contraindications, Adverse Effects, Useful Information, Important Notes on Use of Lifelight® Software, Cautions, Warnings and Precautions:</strong></h3>
      <p><strong>Contraindications:</strong><br>
        Lifelight® has not been validated on pregnant women or on those with atrial fibrillation and so we advise that Lifelight® is not used on these populations.</p>
      <p>Lifelight® is not recommended for persons with low perfusion conditions like anaemia, jaundice, birthmarks, rosacea, psoriasis, acute acne and erythropoietic protoporphyria.</p>
      <p><strong>Adverse Effects:</strong><br>
        No adverse effects or reactions are known, expected or foreseeable with the use of Lifelight® as the product is a medical device software.</p>
      <p><strong>Useful Information:</strong><br>
        Please be aware that vital signs can fluctuate, since they respond to small changes in the body, and with the time of day. It is unusual for them to remain at exactly the same value all the time. If measuring vital signs regularly, e.g. blood pressure on different days, then ideally take measurements at the same time and under the same conditions.</p>
      <p>If a measurement returns results that seems to be abnormal, but if the person does not feel unwell, do not panic, as this can happen. They need to relax and take a break for 5 minutes before measuring vital signs again. Low blood pressure (hypotension), high blood pressure (hypertension), the reasons for consistently fast (tachycardia) or consistently slow (bradycardia) heart rate; can only be diagnosed by a qualified healthcare professional. They are advised that if they have any concerns about the results, to contact their GP surgery or pharmacist.</p>
      <p>Ideally, to get the most accurate values, a minimum of at least one hour should be given after eating, smoking, caffeine, alcohol, or exercise before taking a measurement using Lifelight®, as these may affect the results. Please keep relaxed and keep still during the measurement. Clinicians must verify all vital signs information before administering or changing any type of treatment.</p>
      <p><strong>Important Notes on Use:</strong><br>
        Lifelight® is only intended for the purpose described in these instructions for use. The manufacturer is not liable for damage resulting from improper or careless use.</p>
      <p>In circumstances where a strong heart rate reading is not detected by the software, no vital sign measurements will be returned. </p>
      <p><strong>Cautions:</strong><br>
        This software is not intended for treatment.</p>
      <p><img src="img/caution.svg" alt="caution" width="30px" class="inline-shift"/><strong>Warnings:</strong><br>
        This software doesn&rsquo;t have an alarm for exceeding any limits. Do not use in situations where alarms are required.</p>
      <p><strong>Precautions:</strong><br>
        Lifelight® has not been tested with people with the following conditions which may interfere with measurements. As such, we recommend using a different measurement tool for subjects with the following conditions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Subjects with persistent cardiac arrhythmias.</li>
        <li>Subjects with high concentrations of melanin.</li>
        <li>Subjects with facial tattoos.</li>
        <li>Subjects with facial plastic surgery.</li>
        <li>Subjects with botox injections.</li>
        <li>Subjects with facial scarring or skin flaps.</li>
        <li>Subjects with hypothermia.</li>
        <li>Subjects with hyperthermia.</li>
        <li>Subjects with migraine. </li>
