    <h2>Lifelight®  Intended Purpose / Indications For Use</h2>
    <div class="bg-grey bg-colour-padding ">
      <p>Lifelight® non-contact medical device software is intended for non-invasive measurement of blood pressure (mmHg) and heart rate (bpm), in adult patients aged 18 and above, regardless of ethnicity or gender. The software is not intended for pregnant women, paediatric use, or persons with atrial fibrillation or low perfusion conditions like anaemia, jaundice, birthmarks, rosacea, psoriasis, acute acne and erythropoietic protoporphyria. Lifelight® measures vital physiological parameters through a method called remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) which is a non-invasive means of detecting cardiovascular blood volume pulse (BVP) through small changes in reflected light from the skin surface. Lifelight® works by using a mobile device camera to detect the minute colour changes in the skin of a patient’s face caused by heart beats.</p>
      <p><strong>Intended Patient Population:</strong><br>
        Adult patients aged 18 and above, regardless of ethnicity or gender. This medical device software is not intended for pregnant women, paediatric use, or persons with atrial fibrillation or low perfusion conditions like anaemia, jaundice, birthmarks, rosacea, psoriasis, acute acne and erythropoietic protoporphyria.</p>
      <p><strong>Intended Environments of Use and Intended Users:</strong><br>
        The most likely locations for use are hospitals, clinics, residential care, other healthcare environments and the patient’s home.</p>
      <p>The Lifelight® software is to be used either by healthcare providers, or by a patient who is under the instruction of a healthcare provider.</p>
      <p>Lifelight® is indicated for use with patients at rest, during no-motion, in a well-lit environment.</p>
      <h3><strong>Contraindications, Adverse Effects, Useful Information, Important Notes on Use of Lifelight® Software, Cautions, Warnings and Precautions:</strong></h3>
      <p><strong>Contraindications:</strong><br>
        Lifelight® has not been validated on pregnant women or on those with atrial fibrillation and so we advise that Lifelight® is not used on these populations.</p>
      <p>Lifelight® is not recommended for persons with low perfusion conditions like anaemia, jaundice, birthmarks, rosacea, psoriasis, acute acne and erythropoietic protoporphyria.</p>
      <p><strong>Adverse Effects:</strong><br>
        No adverse effects or reactions are known, expected or foreseeable with the use of Lifelight® as the product is a medical device software.</p>
      <p><strong>Useful Information:</strong><br>
        Please be aware that vital signs can fluctuate, since they respond to small changes in the body, and with the time of day. It is unusual for them to remain at exactly the same value all the time. If measuring vital signs regularly, e.g. blood pressure on different days, then ideally take measurements at the same time and under the same conditions.</p>
      <p>If a measurement returns results that seems to be abnormal, but if the person does not feel unwell, do not panic, as this can happen. They need to relax and take a break for 5 minutes before measuring vital signs again. Low blood pressure (hypotension), high blood pressure (hypertension), the reasons for consistently fast (tachycardia) or consistently slow (bradycardia) heart rate; can only be diagnosed by a qualified healthcare professional. They are advised that if they have any concerns about the results, to contact their GP surgery or pharmacist.</p>
      <p>Ideally, to get the most accurate values, a minimum of at least one hour should be given after eating, smoking, caffeine, alcohol, or exercise before taking a measurement using Lifelight®, as these may affect the results. Please keep relaxed and keep still during the measurement. Clinicians must verify all vital signs information before administering or changing any type of treatment.</p>
      <p><strong>Important Notes on Use:</strong><br>
        Lifelight® is only intended for the purpose described in these instructions for use. The manufacturer is not liable for damage resulting from improper or careless use.</p>
      <p>In circumstances where a strong heart rate reading is not detected by the software, no vital sign measurements will be returned. </p>
      <p><strong>Cautions:</strong><br>
        This software is not intended for treatment.</p>
      <p><img src="img/caution.svg" alt="caution" width="30px" class="inline-shift"/><strong>Warnings:</strong><br>
        This software doesn&rsquo;t have an alarm for exceeding any limits. Do not use in situations where alarms are required.</p>
      <p><strong>Precautions:</strong><br>
        Lifelight® has not been tested with people with the following conditions which may interfere with measurements. As such, we recommend using a different measurement tool for subjects with the following conditions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Subjects with persistent cardiac arrhythmias.</li>
        <li>Subjects with high concentrations of melanin.</li>
        <li>Subjects with facial tattoos.</li>
        <li>Subjects with facial plastic surgery.</li>
        <li>Subjects with botox injections.</li>
        <li>Subjects with facial scarring or skin flaps.</li>
        <li>Subjects with hypothermia.</li>
        <li>Subjects with hyperthermia.</li>
        <li>Subjects with migraine. </li>

        <h2>Terminology</h2>
        <ul>
          <li> <strong>Measurement Signal Quality</strong> or <strong>MSQ</strong> –  is the quality of the data being measured by the device camera. It does not refer to the wifi or data connection.</li>
          <li><strong>Operator</strong> – the person using Lifelight® to measure someone else. E.g. a clinician measuring a patient.</li>
          <li><strong>Subject</strong> – the person being measured. Either by themselves using the app or by another person called the operator in this document.</li>
          <li><strong>Device</strong> – the smart phone or tablet running the Lifelight® application. </li>
          <li><strong>Monitor</strong> – the Lifelight® application running on the device connected to the remote algorithm that returns the results. </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h2>Warnings</h2>
    <p> Warning and statements can appear within the app or in this document. </p>
    <p>The app is safe for patients and clinicians when used in accordance with the instructions and the warning statements presented in these Instructions For Use.</p>
    <p>Before using the app, you must familiarize yourself with all warnings to ensure good measurement signal quality and usable  measurements.</p>
    <p>In addition to reviewing the general warnings presented in the next section, you must also review the more specific instructions found in the Preparation and Set-up, Taking a Measurement and Maintenance sections. </p>
    <ul>
      <li class="strong">Failure to understand and observe any warning statement in this manual could lead to poor signal quality and no measurements returned or inaccurate results.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><img src="img/caution.svg" alt="caution" width="60px" class="inline-shift"/> WARNING:</h2>
    <h2 class="strong">Low Measurement Signal Quality</h2>
    <p class="strong">Low MSQ, leading to no results returned at the end of the measurement, can occur with one or more of the following causes:</p>
    <h3>Lighting</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>The subject (the person being measured) is poorly lit.</li>
      <li>The subject is strongly lit from behind or above and not adequately from in front.</li>
      <li>The background to the subject is very brightly lit.</li>
      <li>A mirror or reflective surface is in the background of the subject.</li>
      <li>There are strong shadows on the subject’s forehead and cheeks.</li>
      <li>The light changes during the measurement. Other than flickering lights, this could be caused by people or objects moving in the background. </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Movement</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>The device is moving too much during the measurement. If you can't hold the device still, avoid hand-holding the device and instead use a stand or steady the device against an object. </li>
      <li>The subject may be moving too much such as talking or looking around during the measurement. (Blinking and slight movements caused by breathing should not affect MSQ.)</li>
      <li>A subject with Tourette's syndrome may move  during the measurement and so alternative measurement tools are recommended.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Other</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>There is not an adequate wifi or data connection to upload the data. </li>
      <li>The subject does not have their forehead and cheeks visible.</li>
      <li>The  device lens is not clean.</li>

    <h3>What Lifelight® does and how it works</h3>
    <div class="text-column">
      <p>Lifelight® is a software application that is a medical device. It is intended to be a simple way to estimate heart rate and blood pressure in 60 seconds or less. Through the device camera, the software measures changes in facial skin colour each time the heart beats. When the colour information is  processed, the software provides  measurements for heart rate and blood pressure.</p>

  <section id="benefits"> <!--benefits-->
    <h2>Intended Benefits</h2>
    <div class="text-column">
      <p>Lifelight®&rsquo;s performance benefits that have been determined from the meta-analysis of VISION V and VISION Acute studies as part of the clinical evaluation conducted on Lifelight® are:</p>
      <p><strong>Benefit 1.</strong> Measure heart rate with an accuracy and precision of 1.34 beats per minute rms error for a validated range of 52 – 107 BPM. </p>
      <p><strong>Benefit 2.</strong> Measure systolic blood pressure with an accuracy and precision of mean error (sd) 6.65 (±16.5) mmHg for a validated range: 81 – 192 mmHg. </p>
      <p><strong>Benefit 3.</strong> Measure diastolic blood pressure with an accuracy and precision of mean error (sd) -0.03 (±12.0) mmHg for a validated range: 48 – 107 mmHg.</p>
      <p>These four benefits apply to all intended patient populations, environments of use and intended users of Lifelight<em>®</em>. </p>
      <p>Lifelight<em>®</em> allows for remote heart rate and blood pressure measurement through a mobile device camera. </p>
      <h3>Patient-relevant benefits of remote/self-monitoring are as follows: </h3>
      <p><strong>Benefit 4.</strong>. Remote blood pressure monitoring can lead to improved blood pressure control.</p>
      <p><strong>Benefit 5.</strong> Remote blood pressure monitoring can lead to an improved drug compliance rate. </p>
      <p><strong>Benefit 6.</strong>. Remote vital sign monitoring can help individuals facing geographic and logistical obstacles e.g. living in a rural area or having limited mobility/transportation, to be assisted by clinicians keeping track of their health status whilst at home. </p>
      <p><strong>Benefit 7.</strong> Blood pressure and heart rate can be measured remotely for a remote consultation which facilitates the avoidance of direct physical contact, thus avoiding the risk of viral transmission.</p>
      <p><strong>Benefit 8. </strong>Self-measurement of blood pressure at home provides more reliable and reproducible estimations of blood pressure, including minimisation of white-coat effect and the detection of masked hypertension.</p>
      <p><strong>Benefit 9.</strong> Blood pressure accuracy is maintained over long-term usage e.g. longitudinal self-monitoring at home, because calibration is not required, thus avoiding the risk of calibration error.</p>
      <p><strong>Benefits 4 – 8</strong> apply to a portion of Lifelight<em>®</em>&rsquo;s intended users who will use the medical device software remotely and under the guidance of a healthcare professional. Meanwhile, Benefit 10 applies to all intended patient populations, environments of use and intended users of Lifelight<em>®</em>. </p>
      <h3> Patient-relevant benefits of contactless vital sign measurement are as follows: </h3>
      <p><strong>Benefit 10.</strong> Contactless blood pressure measurement is more comfortable and thus better tolerated than traditional blood pressure cuffs because it avoids pain or distress associated with upper arm compression.</p>
      <p><strong>Benefit 11. </strong>Contactless vital sign measurement alleviates sleep disturbance caused by the discomfort and sometimes pain of traditional blood pressure monitoring devices during sleep. </p>
      <p><strong>Benefit 12.</strong> Contactless vital sign measurement avoids the possibility of contracting an infection using contact-based measurement methods.</p>
      <p><strong>Benefit 13.</strong> Contactless blood pressure measurement negates the need to roll up a person&rsquo;s sleeves - as is required for standard-of-care blood pressure cuffs.</p>
      <p><strong>Benefit 14.</strong> Traditional contact monitoring methods such as ECG and pulse oximeter require patients to wear adhesive sensors, electrodes and chest straps potentially for a long time, which can cause discomfort, infection or other adverse events. Contactless vital sign measurement allows patients with sensitive skin e.g. those suffering burns, to have their vital signs measured whilst avoiding these potential risks.</p>
      <p><strong>Benefits 10-14</strong> apply to all intended patient populations, environments of use and intended users of Lifelight<em>®</em>.    </p>

  <section id="preparation"><!--Preparation and setup-->
    <h2> Preparation and set up of Lifelight® before taking a measurement. </h2>
    <h3>Device preparation and minimum requirements.</h3>
    <div class="text-column">
      <ul>
        <li>Lifelight® is designed to work on a range of validated  devices – on iPad 6(9.7), iPad 7(10.2) and iPad 8(10.2). Ensure the device’s operating system is up to date.</li>
        <li>No calibration is required. </li>
        <li>Make sure you are using the latest version of the Lifelight® app.</li>
        <li>Ensure the device is adequately charged for your requirements. </li>
        <li>Ensure the device lenses are clean.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h3>IT networks characteristics and IT security measures.</h3>
    <div class="text-column">
      <ul>
        <li>Lifelight® requires a stable connection to the internet to function.</li>
        <li> The minimum connection speed required is 0.128 mbps upload and 0.128 mbps download. </li>
        <li>For the software to run as intended, the connection to the Wi-Fi must be secure and protected from unauthorized access.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h3>Keeping the device still.</h3>
    <div class="text-column">
      <ul>
        <li>The device running Lifelight® must be held as still as possible when taking a measurement.</li>
        <li>If the device is held in a stand resting on a surface, that surface should be free from movement or vibration.</li>
        <li>Ideal stands allow the device to be repositioned and angled to accommodate the different heights of subjects if used by an operator for multiple subjects.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h3>Environment, lighting and special facilities.</h3>
    <div class="text-column">
      <ul>
        <li>For optimum Lifelight® results, the environment, room or space should be distraction-free and allow the subject’s face to be well illuminated.</li>
        <li>Ideal lighting conditions allow the subject’s face to be well lit  without strong shadows. Multiple strong, diffuse light sources are ideal.</li>
        <li>Lifelight® may function poorly if the subject’s face is lit from a single strong light source that creates strong shadows across the forehead and cheeks. </li>
        <li>Lifelight® may function poorly if the subject is strongly backlit, and/or if the space the subject is in is strongly lit and the subject isn’t.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h3>Subject – the person being measured.</h3>
    <div class="text-column">
      <ul>
        <li>Lifelight® is validated for subjects age 18 and above. </li>
        <li>Lifelight® works by measuring skin colour from cheeks and forehead. Therefore these areas of the subject's face must be visible and well illuminated.</li>
        <li>Subjects should remove glasses, hats and headscarves if they obscure  facial skin or create strong shadows. </li>
        <li>Subjects should arrange  hair so that their facial skin is exposed and free from strong shadows. </li>
        <li>If it is safe to do so under clinical guidance, remove masks (such as oxygen masks) for the duration of the measurement. </li>
        <li>Some subjects are concerned that they are being videoed. Lifelight® only uses the images taken with the camera to measure the numeric colour values of facial skin. It is only these numeric colour values that are used to calculate the vital signs. The images are discarded. </li>
        <li>Subjects should avoid food, caffeine, tobacco and alcohol for at least 1 hour before taking a measurement. </li>
        <li>Subjects should sit quietly for a few minutes before taking the measurement.</li>
        <li>Subjects should be  relaxed with their back and feet supported and arms and legs uncrossed.</li>

    <h2>When to retake a measurement</h2>
    <div class="text-column">
      <p>You can retake a measurement if there is any reason to assume a poor measurement has occurred.</p>
      <p>It is possible to cancel the measurement before the end and restart.</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Retake if the final overall MSQ is low. (When overall signal quality is low no results will be displayed; ‘?’ will show in place of figures.)</li>
        <li>Retake if the subject moves or talks during the measurement.</li>
        <li>Retake if the table or stand is knocked or moved during the measurement.</li>
        <li>Retake if the light is interrupted or changes, as might happen if something passes across or light source or lighting is turned on or off.</li>

    <h2>Measuring degree of accuracy</h2>
    <div class="text-column">
      <h3>Heart rate</h3>
      <p>Measure heart rate with an accuracy and precision of 1.4 ± 3.8 bpm in the range of 47 – 127 bpm.</p>
      <h3>Systolic Blood Pressure</h3>
      <p>Measure systolic blood pressure with an accuracy and precision of 2.6 ± 15.8 mmHg in the range of 96 – 179 mmHg.</p>
      <h3><strong>Diastolic Blood Pressure</strong></h3>
      <p>Measure diastolic blood pressure with an accuracy and precision of -0.1 ± 10.6 mmHg in the range of 52 – 128.5 mmHg.</p>
      <h3>Validation</h3>
      <p>The above data is based on the Lifelight® validation study, which is a meta-analysis of two clinical investigations:<u></u><u></u></p>
      <ol start="1" type="1">
        <li><em>A single-centre study to demonstrate the safety and performance of Lifelight® First software application - a non-invasive vital signs monitoring device: VISION V</em></li>
        <li><em>The measurement of VItal SIgns by Lifelight® Data Collect software in comparisON to the standard of care in acutely unwell patients - The VISION Acute study.</em></li>
      </ol>
      <p>Lifelight®’s algorithms have been trained using data from multiple clinical studies, which recorded heart rates from 36-139 bpm, systolic blood pressures from 71-219 mmHg and diastolic blood pressures from 37-149 mmHg.</p>

    <h2>Technical Description</h2>
    <div class="text-column">
      <p>Lifelight® runs only on validated devices. These are the iPad 6th Generation (9.7&quot;), iPad 7th Generation (10.2&quot;), and iPad 8th Generation (10.2&quot;) using iOS 14.3 or later.</p>
      <p>The software is installed using the Apple software distribution app 'TestFlight'. Please follow the instructions on TestFlight to install a copy of the Lifelight App. </p>
      <p>During installation you will be asked to allow access to the device's camera. You must accept this request or Lifelight® will not function. </p>
      <p>Once installed, Lifelight® is fully configured and needs no further setup or calibration. </p>
      <p>Lifelight® uses light reflected from the face to take a measurement. As such it should be used with the subject's face well lit. Temperature and humidity (in so far as they do not affect the lighting of the subject) will not interfere with the functioning of Lifelight®. </p>
      <p>Lifelight® communicates with a secure server hosted by Amazon Web Services (AWS) in order to calculate the vital signs displayed. In order to function, the Lifelight® app needs a good quality connection with the Internet via a strong WiFi signal. On launching and before a measurement is taken, Lifelight® tests the strength of the connection and will not enable a measurement to be completed (and display a warning) if the connection is too weak. If the connection should fail, or be corrupted in any way then the reading will fail with a warning message. </p>
      <p>Other than access to the Internet, Lifelight® has no further network requirements. As a stand alone app, Lifelight® does not connect with any other IT network or service. </p>
      <p>Data is sent to the server securely over an encrypted channel, is stored securely on the AWS system, and contains no personally identifiable data (PID). The only data sent is age, height, sex and the average colour of the subject's face (measured 30 times a second). </p>
