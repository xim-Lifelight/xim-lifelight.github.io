    <h2>Lifelight® EA&nbsp; Intended Use / Indications For Use</h2>
    <div class="bg-grey bg-colour-padding column-holder">
      <div class="column2">
        <p>Lifelight® EA non-contact patient monitor is intended for indicative estimates for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>non-invasive blood pressure (mmhg),</li>
          <li>pulse rate (bpm),</li>
          <li>and respiration rate (rpm) measurements.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Intended patient populations include: adult patients. The monitor is not intended for paediatric use.</p>
        <p>The most likely locations for use are hospitals, clinics, residential care, other healthcare environments and the patient’s home.</p>
        <p>The Lifelight® EA patient monitor is to be used either by care providers, or by a patient who has been advised in its appropriate use by a care provider.</p>
        <p>Lifelight® EA is indicated for use with patients at rest, during no-motion, in a well-lit environment.</p>
        <p><strong>NOTE: Lifelight® EA is intended for informational use only. It should not be used for direct diagnosis or monitoring of vital physiological processes and is not intended to replace traditional methods of diagnosis or treatment.</strong></p>
      </div>
      <div class="column2">
        <h3><strong>Exceptions</strong> / Warning:</h3>
        <p><strong>For the attention of healthcare practitioners:</strong><br>
          Some drugs, therapies, health and skin conditions (including cosmetics, facial tattoos and excessive sweat) may interfere with readings – therefore clinicians must verify all vital signs information before using results from Lifelight® EA for informational purposes.</p>
        <p>If there is any reason to question the accuracy of the results, use other clinically valid methods for verification.</p>
        <p><strong>For the attention of patients and/or their carers and care providers:</strong><br>
          Please be aware that vital signs can fluctuate, since they respond to small changes in the body, and with the time of day. It is unusual for them to remain at exactly the same value all the time. If you are measuring your vital signs regularly, e.g. blood pressure on different days, you should ideally take measurements at the same time and under the same conditions.</p>
        <p>If a measurement returns results that seems to be abnormal, but you do not feel unwell, do not panic, as this can happen. Relax and take a break for 5 minutes before measuring vital signs again. Low blood pressure (hypotension), high blood pressure (hypertension), the reasons for consistently fast (tachycardia) or consistently slow (bradycardia) heart rate; or for unusual respiratory rates, can only be diagnosed by a qualified healthcare professional. If you have any concerns about your results, please contact your GP surgery or pharmacist.</p>
        <p>Ideally, to get the most accurate values, you should wait at least an hour after eating, smoking, caffeine, alcohol, or exercise, as these may affect the results. You should be relaxed and keep still during the measurement. Do not use this monitor if you suffer from atrial or ventricular premature beats or atrial fibrillation.</p>

        <h2 class="strong">Low Measurement Signal Quality</h2>
        <p class="strong">Low MSQ, leading to no results returned at the end of the measurement, can occur with one or more of the following causes:</p>
        <h3>Lighting</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>The subject (the person being measured) is poorly lit.</li>
          <li>The subject is strongly lit from behind or above and not adequately from in front.</li>
          <li>The background to the subject is very brightly lit.</li>
          <li>A mirror or reflective surface is in the background of the subject.</li>
          <li>There are strong shadows on the subject’s forehead and cheeks.</li>
          <li>The light changes during the measurement. Other than flickering lights, this could be caused by people or objects moving in the background. </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Movement</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>The device is moving too much during the measurement. If you can't hold the device still, avoid hand-holding the device and instead use a stand or steady the device against an object. </li>
          <li>The subject may be moving too much such as talking or looking around during the measurement. (Blinking and slight movements caused by breathing should not affect MSQ.)</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Other</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>There is not an adequate wifi or data connection to upload the data. </li>
          <li>The subject does not have their forehead and cheeks visible.</li>
          <li>The  device lens is not clean.</li>

    <h3>What Lifelight® EA does and how it works</h3>
    <div class="text-column">
      <p>Lifelight® EA is a software application that is a medical device. It is intended to be a simple way to estimate pulse, respiration and blood pressure in 40 seconds or less. Through the device camera, the software measures changes in facial skin colour each time the heart beats. When the colour information is  processed, the software provides  measurements for pulse, respiration  and blood pressure.</p>

  <section id="preparation"><!--Preparation and setup-->
    <h2> Preparation and set up of Lifelight® EA before taking a measurement. </h2>
    <h3>Device preparation and minimum requirements.</h3>
    <div class="text-column">
      <ul>
        <li>Lifelight® EA is designed to work on a range of validated mobile devices. Ensure the device’s operating system is up to date.</li>
        <li>Make sure you are using the latest version of the Lifelight® EA app.</li>
        <li>Ensure the device is adequately charged for your requirements. </li>
        <li>Ensure the device lenses are clean.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h3>IT networks characteristics and IT security measures.</h3>
    <div class="text-column">
      <ul>
        <li>Lifelight® EA requires a stable connection to the internet to function.</li>
        <li> The minimum connection speed required is 0.128 mbps upload and 0.128 mbps download. </li>
        <li>For the software to run as intended, the connection to the Wi-Fi must be secure and protected from unauthorized access.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h3>Keeping the device still.</h3>
    <div class="text-column">
      <ul>
        <li>The device running Lifelight® EA must be held as still as possible when taking a measurement.</li>
        <li>If the device is held in a stand resting on a surface, that surface should be free from movement or vibration.</li>
        <li>Ideal stands allow the device to be repositioned and angled to accommodate the different heights of subjects if used by an operator for multiple subjects.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h3>Environment, lighting and special facilities.</h3>
    <div class="text-column">
      <ul>
        <li>For optimum Lifelight®  EA results, the environment, room or space should be distraction-free and allow the subject’s face to be well illuminated.</li>
        <li>Ideal lighting conditions allow the subject’s face to be well lit  without strong shadows. Multiple strong, diffuse light sources are ideal.</li>
        <li>Lifelight® EA may function poorly if the subject’s face is lit from a single strong light source that creates strong shadows across the forehead and cheeks. </li>
        <li>Lifelight® EA may function poorly if the subject is strongly backlit, and/or if the space the subject is in is strongly lit and the subject isn’t.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h3>Subject – the person being measured.</h3>
    <div class="text-column">
      <ul>
        <li>Lifelight® EA is validated for subjects age 18 and above. </li>
        <li>Lifelight® EA works by measuring skin colour from cheeks and forehead. Therefore these areas of the subject's face must be visible and well illuminated.</li>
        <li>Subjects should remove glasses, hats and heads-carves if they obscure  facial skin or create strong shadows. </li>
        <li>Subjects should arrange  hair so that their facial skin is exposed and free from strong shadows. </li>
        <li>If it is safe to do so under clinical guidance, remove masks (such as oxygen masks) for the duration of the measurement. </li>
        <li>Some subjects are concerned that they are being videoed. Lifelight® EA only uses the images taken with the camera to measure the numeric colour values of facial skin. It is only these numeric colour values that are used to calculate the vital signs. The images are discarded. </li>
        <li>Subjects should avoid food, caffeine, tobacco and alcohol for at least 1 hour before taking a measurement. </li>
        <li>Subjects should sit quietly for a few minutes before taking the measurement.</li>
        <li>Subjects should be  relaxed with their back and feet supported and arms and legs uncrossed.</li>

    <h2>When to retake a measurement</h2>
    <div class="text-column">
      <p>You can retake a measurement if there is any reason to assume a poor measurement has occurred.</p>
      <p>It is possible to cancel the measurement before the end and restart.</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Retake if the final overall signal quality is low. (When overall signal quality is low no results will be displayed; ‘?’ will show in place of figures.)</li>
        <li>Retake if the subject moves or talks during the measurement.</li>
        <li>Retake if the table or stand is knocked or moved during the measurement.</li>
        <li>Retake if the light is interrupted or changes, as might happen if something passes across or light source or lighting is turned on or off.</li>

    <h2>Measuring degree of accuracy</h2>
    <div class="text-column">
      <h3>Pulse rate</h3>
      <p>4.0 beats per minute rms error in compliance with ISO 80601-2-61:2019.<br>
        Mean error (sd): -1.4 (±3.8) bpm<br>
      Validated range: 47 – 127 BPM</p>
<h3>Respiration rate</h3>
      <p>3.4 breaths per minute rms error<br>
        Mean error (sd): -0.13 (±3.4) bpm<br>
        89.5% of measurements within 5 breaths per minute<br>
        Validated range: 6 – 27 breaths per minute</p>
      <h3>Systolic Blood Pressure</h3>
      <p>Mean error (sd) 2.9 (±13.5) mmHg</p>
      <p>Lifelight® EA meets BS EN ISO 81060-2:2019 and ANSI/AAMI SP10:2002 standards for cuff-type sphygmomanometers with regards to systolic blood pressure mean error (2.9 &lt; 5) but does not currently meet standard deviation (13.5 &gt; 8). For a mean error of 2.9 mmHg, the maximum allowable standard deviation of the averaged paired determinations per subject in this validation study (sm) is 6.3 mmHg. Lifelight® EA currently has a sm of 9.5 mmHg. Therefore, Lifelight® EA does not currently achieve the ISO standard requirement for cuff-type sphygmomanometers with regards to intra-subject variability. It currently achieves Grade D when assessed against the British Hypertension Society protocol requirements for cuff-type sphygmomanometers.</p>
<h3><strong>Diastolic Blood Pressure</strong></h3>
      <p> Mean error (sd) 0.18 (±7.2) mmHg</p>
      <p>Lifelight® EA meets BS EN ISO 81060-2:2014 and ANSI/AAMI SP10:2002 and ISO/ANSI/AAMI 81060-2:2013 standards for cuff-type sphygmomanometers with regards to diastolic blood pressure mean error (as 0.18 &lt; 5) and standard deviation (as 7.2 &lt; 8). For a mean error of 0.18 mmHg, the maximum allowable standard deviation of the averaged paired determinations per subject (sm) is 6.95 mmHg. Lifelight® EA currently has a sm of 5.1 mmHg. Therefore, Lifelight® EA also meets the ISO standard requirement for cuff-type sphygmomanometers with regards to intra-subject variability, when assessing the available validation study data. It currently achieves Grade B when assessed against the British Hypertension Society protocol requirements for cuff-type sphygmomanometers.</p>
<h3>Validation</h3>
      <p>The above data is based on the&nbsp;Lifelight®  validation study: &ldquo;<em>Validation in adults aged 18+ of the xim Lifelight®  pulse, respiratory rate and blood pressure monitor according to &ldquo;Medical electrical equipment – Part 2:61: Particular requirements for basic safety and essential performance of pulse oximeter equipment&rdquo; ISO 80601-2-61:2019, &ldquo;Non-invasive Sphygmomanometers Part 2: Clinical investigation of automated measurement type&rdquo; BS EN ISO 81060-2:2019, and the British Hypertension Society protocol for the evaluation of blood pressure measuring devices 1993.&rdquo;</em></p>
      <p>Lifelight® EA algorithms have been trained from an 8,585 participant study at Portsmouth Hospitals Trust (&ldquo;Vision-D study&rdquo;), which recorded heart rates from 32-207BPM, respiratory rates from 8-23BPM, systolic blood pressures from 61-223mmHg and diastolic blood pressures from 32-136mmHg.</p>
