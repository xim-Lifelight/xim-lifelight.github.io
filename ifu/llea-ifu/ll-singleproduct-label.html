            <ul>
              <li> non-invasive blood pressure (mmhg), </li>
              <li> pulse rate (bpm), </li>
              <li> and respiration rate (rpm) measurements. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Intended patient populations include: adult patients. The monitor is not intended for paediatric use. </p>
            <p>The most likely locations for use are hospitals, clinics, residential care, other healthcare environments and the patient&rsquo;s home. </p>
            <p>The Lifelight® EA patient monitor is to be used either by care providers, or by a patient who has been advised in its appropriate use by a care provider. </p>
            <p>Lifelight® EA is indicated for use with patients at rest, during no-motion, in a well-lit environment. </p>
            <p><strong>NOTE: Lifelight® EA is intended for informational use only. It should not be used for direct diagnosis or monitoring of vital physiological processes and is not intended to replace traditional methods of diagnosis or treatment.</strong></p>

      <h3><strong>Exceptions</strong> / Warning:</h3>
      <p><strong>For the attention of healthcare practitioners:</strong><br>
        Some drugs, therapies, health and skin conditions (including cosmetics, facial tattoos and excessive sweat) may interfere with readings – therefore clinicians must verify all vital signs information before using results from Lifelight® EA for informational purposes. </p>
      <p>If there is any reason to question the accuracy of the results, use other clinically valid methods for verification.</p>
      <p><strong>For the attention of patients and/or their carers and care providers:</strong><br>
        Please be aware that vital signs can fluctuate, since they respond to small changes in the body, and with the time of day. It is unusual for them to remain at exactly the same value all the time. If you are measuring your vital signs regularly, e.g. blood pressure on different days, you should ideally take measurements at the same time and under the same conditions.</p>
      <p>If a measurement returns results that seems to be abnormal, but you do not feel unwell, do not panic, as this can happen. Relax and take a break for 5 minutes before measuring vital signs again. Low blood pressure (hypotension), high blood pressure (hypertension), the reasons for consistently fast (tachycardia) or consistently slow (bradycardia) heart rate; or for unusual respiratory rates, can only be diagnosed by a qualified healthcare professional. If you have any concerns about your results, please contact your GP surgery or pharmacist. </p>
      <p>Ideally, to get the most accurate values, you should wait at least an hour after eating, smoking, caffeine, alcohol, or exercise, as these may affect the results. You should be relaxed and keep still during the measurement. Do not use this monitor if you suffer from atrial or ventricular premature beats or atrial fibrillation.</p>
