        <p>We regard your privacy and the handling of your personal data with the utmost
            importance. This Privacy Notice details how we collect, use and securely store
            any personal data submitted to us through use of our website (https://lifelight.ai)
            and the Lifelight application and services provided as part of the application

        <h3>Our roles when handling personal data</h3>
        <p>We are what is known as a ‘data controller’ for processing your personal data
            submitted to us through our website.</p>
        <p>For patient or user data submitted to us through use of our Lifelight Application,
            Xim is what is known as the ‘data processor’ and not the ‘data controller’ other than
            where Xim is required to store your data to comply with its regulatory
            obligations in which case Xim is a ‘data controller’.</p>
        <p>The data controller has the primary role in relation to decisions concerning your
            personal data, such as when you exercise any rights available to you under data
            protection laws, though we (as a data processor) also have responsibilities in
            relation to the security of your personal data. Where we are acting as a ‘data
            processor’, we will be sharing your personal data with the ‘data controller’ such
            as your healthcare provider, intermediaries providing services to your healthcare
            provider or service provider who made the Lifelight Application available to you
            as part of their own product.</p>

            data. We rely on one or more of the following legal bases:</p>
        <ul>

            to request the deletion or removal of your information that we hold and where
            there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. Note, however, that we
            may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal
            reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
        </p>
        <p><strong>
            The right to restrict processing:
        </strong></p>
        <p>
            You have rights to ‘block’ or suppress further use of your information. When
            processing is restricted, we can still store your information, but will not use it
            further except in limited circumstances.
        </p>
        <p><strong>
            The right to object to processing:
        </strong></p>
        <p>
            You have the right to object to certain types of processing, including processing
            for direct marketing (i.e. receiving information about Xim’s products and services
            which may be of interest to you via email or post) or where we are relying on a
            legitimate interest as the legal basis for processing. In some cases, we may
            demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your
            information which override your right to object although you have an absolute
            right to object where we are processing your data for direct marketing purposes.
        </p>
        <p><strong>
            The right to data portability:
        </strong></p>
        <p>
            You have the right to obtain and reuse your information for your own purposes
            across different services. To our best ability we will provide your information in
            an easily accessible format.
        </p>
        <p><strong>
            The right to lodge a complaint:
        </strong></p>
        <p>
            You have the right to lodge a complaint about the way we handle or process your
            information with the national data protection regulator.
        </p>
        <p><strong>
            The right to withdraw consent:
        </strong></p>
        <p>
            If you have given your consent to anything we do with your information (i.e. we
            rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your information), you have the
            right to withdraw that consent at any time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please note that withdrawing your consent does not make unlawful what we have
            done with your personal data up to that point (when your consent was active).
        </p>
        <p>
            If we receive a request from you to exercise any of the above rights, we may ask
            you to verify your identity before acting on the request; this is to ensure that your
            data is protected and kept secure. We may also contact you to ask you for further
            information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
